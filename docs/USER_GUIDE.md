## What is MeshMini?
A tiny text‑based message board for Meshtastic. No fluff. You can post, read, reply, discover nodes, and DM people by their short name. Admins can set a notice that’s shown when you ask for the menu with `?`.

## Getting help
- Send `?` — you’ll see the notice (if set) and a compact one‑line menu.
- Send `??` — detailed help.

## Common commands
